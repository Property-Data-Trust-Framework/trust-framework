## Proof of Concept 4 Support

**Critical for iterative framework evolution**: PoC4 represents an essential opportunity to validate and refine the Property Data Trust Framework through real-world application. This proof of concept serves as a crucial feedback mechanism, allowing the framework to evolve based on practical implementation experiences rather than purely theoretical design.

### PoC4 Implementation Support

- [ ] Stand up reference implementation for PoC participants
- [ ] Integrate with PoC participant systems and workflows
- [ ] Provide ongoing technical support during PoC execution period
- [ ] Facilitate real-time issue resolution and system adjustments
- [ ] Collect comprehensive feedback from all participating stakeholders
- [ ] Iterate on implementations based on participant experiences
- [ ] Document lessons learned and emerging integration patterns
- [ ] Capture use case variations and edge cases discovered during PoC
- [ ] Validate framework assumptions against real-world property transactions
- [ ] Test interoperability between different participant systems

### PoC4 Framework Evolution Benefits

The proof of concept approach ensures that:
- **Real-world validation**: Framework specifications are tested against actual property industry workflows
- **Stakeholder feedback integration**: Direct input from property professionals, lenders, and other ecosystem participants
- **Iterative improvement**: Continuous refinement based on practical implementation challenges
- **Risk mitigation**: Early identification of technical and operational issues before full framework rollout
- **Ecosystem alignment**: Ensures the framework meets genuine market needs and participant requirements
- **Standards refinement**: Real-world usage informs specification improvements and clarifications
