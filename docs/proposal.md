# Technical Implementation Proposal

## Preamble

The Property Data Trust Framework represents a transformative initiative that will establish the technical foundation for secure, interoperable property data exchange across the UK property ecosystem. This work will create standardized verifiable credentials infrastructure that enables trusted data sharing between property professionals, financial institutions, government bodies, and other stakeholders while maintaining privacy and security.

**Building on v1.0 foundations, this v2.0 Framework delivers critical improvements:**

- **Comprehensive Entity Modeling**: Unlike v1.0's limited scope, v2.0 correctly models the full spectrum of property ecosystem entities—transactions, property titles/ownership, participant credentials, and detailed property data—ensuring accurate representation of complex real-world relationships and dependencies.

- **Robust Permissions & Authorization**: v2.0 introduces sophisticated OAuth/OIDC integration and granular permission frameworks that were absent in v1.0, enabling fine-grained access control, secure API interactions, and enterprise-grade authorization mechanisms that meet regulatory and compliance requirements.

- **Advanced Terms of Use Mechanisms**: The Framework now includes comprehensive terms of service infrastructure, participant agreement templates, and automated compliance checking—addressing v1.0's gaps in legal Framework integration and ensuring all data exchanges operate within clearly defined legal boundaries.

- **Fully Digitally Verifiable Provenance**: v2.0 implements complete cryptographic audit trails using W3C Verifiable Credentials standards, Bitstring Status Lists for revocation, and immutable provenance tracking—delivering the end-to-end verification capabilities that v1.0 lacked.

The Framework's value extends beyond technical specifications—it will reduce transaction friction, eliminate redundant data collection, improve data quality and provenance, and enable new innovative services built on verified property data. By establishing common standards and reference implementations, this work will accelerate ecosystem-wide adoption and ensure consistent, reliable interoperability.

**All development will be conducted in close collaboration with Open Property Data Association (OPDA) members**, ensuring that the technical solutions address real-world requirements and industry best practices. Regular consultation with OPDA stakeholders will guide design decisions, validate implementations, and ensure the Framework meets the diverse needs of the property data ecosystem.

## Overview

This proposal outlines the technical implementation tasks from the Property Data Trust Framework Development Plan, focusing on core infrastructure development. The proposal covers Technical Standards (1.2), Registry Implementation (Phase 2), Core NPM Package (3.1), Implementation Guides & Documentation (Phase 4), Reference Implementations (Phase 5), and Test Infrastructure (6.1).

## Dependencies and Critical Path

1. **Technical Standards (1.2)** must be completed first as they define the foundation
2. **Schema Development (2.1)** depends on Technical Standards
3. **Trust Registry (2.2)** can be developed in parallel with Schema Development
4. **Core NPM Package (3.1)** depends on completed schemas and registry APIs
5. **Documentation (Phase 4)** should follow implementation completion
6. **Reference Implementations (Phase 5)** depend on completed NPM package and documentation
7. **Proof of Concept 4 Support** can run in parallel with Phase 5 development, using early implementations
8. **Test Infrastructure (6.1)** should be developed alongside core implementations for continuous validation

## Risk Considerations

- Schema design changes may impact downstream development
- OAuth/OIDC integration complexity could extend timeline
- Status list implementation may require additional W3C standards research
- Documentation accuracy depends on stable API implementations
