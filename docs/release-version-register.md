# PDTF Release Version Register

A Release Version Register acts as a record for each PDTF-compliant organisation to share details about the current version they adhere to and their intention to continue developing towards improved standards.  

This serves as:
- A **reference tool** to enable stakeholder organisations to align on interoperability standards.
- A **tracking mechanism** to monitor the maturity of the PDTF and understand adoption trends.
