# PDTF Compliance and Regulatory Checklist

The PDTF aims to foster a trusted, interoperable, and standardised environment for property transactions. To achieve this, all participants must adhere to a robust set of compliance and regulatory policies, ensuring confidence in the trust framework.

This checklist demonstrates participants’ commitment to transparency, regulatory compliance, and alignment with best practices. 

If participants cannot provide the required information, they should document the steps they are taking to achieve compliance or mitigate associated risks.
